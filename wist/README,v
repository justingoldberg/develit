@WIST - Web Interface for SIP Trace
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


INTRO

This software born as a prof concept of the idea to capture SIP traffic  from  a
remote host (SIP Proxy, Gateway, etc) and  show  up  alive  SIP  messages  about
an specific dialog (filtered by From SIP user) to help  our  tech  support  team
to debug SIP transactions in a friendly way.

There are 3 peaces of software in this process, 2 of them was created by us:

 1) ngrep: Created by Jordan Ritter - http://ngrep.sourceforge.net
    ngrep  strives  to   provide   most   of   GNU   grep's   common   features,
    applying  them  to  the  network  layer.   ngrep  is   a   pcap-aware   tool
    that  will  allow  you  to   specify   extended   regular   or   hexadecimal
    expressions   to   match   against   data   payloads   of    packets.     It
    currently  recognizes  TCP,  UDP  and  ICMP  across  Ethernet,  PPP,   SLIP,
    FDDI,  Token  Ring  and  null  interfaces,  and   understands   bpf   filter
    logic  in  the  same  fashion  as  more  common   packet   sniffing   tools,
    such as tcpdump and snoop.
	
 2) siptraced: Created by Devel-IT - http://www.devel.it
    siptraced is a perl daemon who reads a ngrep log file and push each line  on
    a TCP port, so every one connected on this  port  will  listen  all  traffic
    captured  by  ngrep  (dangerous  and  perhaps   a   waste   of   bandwidth).
    There is no user/IP authentication yet.

 3) WIST: Created by Devel-IT - http://www.devel.it
    WIST is a PHP Web Interface who permits you to connect on a remote host/port
    and listen/filter a SIP dialog of an specific SIP From number,  avoiding  to
    listen all captured traffic pushed by siptraced. The STOP control is done by
    browser's stop button.   The  output  is  colorized  and  "Call-ID"  tag  is
    highlighted to make it simple to be located.
    You can run WIST on any host running a Web Server  with  PHP  >=  4.0.x  and
    authorized to connect on siptraced remote TCP port.


There  is  no  guarantee  about  our  softwares,  use  it  by  your  own   risk.
