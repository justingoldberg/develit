Motorview - SIP Trace Viewer - v2.1
Post by LRU » 26 Apr 2010 05:50

Motorview is a utility to view log files containing SIP messages. It generates a browsable line-by-line summary of SIP messages from traces and displays them in color. It can also be used to filter on specific messages. The tool features a graphical user interface (GUI) but can also be used from the command line in order to print the summary to the console or a file.

As of version 2.0, it works for:
* OminPCX Enterprise (OXE) motortrace, including OXE R10 with changed date format
* Integrated Communications Server (ICS/OTUC) SIP logs
* OmniTouch FAX Server (OFS) SIP logs (6.5)
* Genesys SIP Server (ICE) logs

Important Note: The application comes in form of a Python script. It requires Python 2.7 or above, but below 3.0.

* Download Python 2.7 for Windows: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi
* Choose Python for another platform: http://www.python.org/download/

Tip for Windows users: Create a link on your desktop with the following Target: "C:\Python27\pythonw.exe C:\Programs\motview.py" (Replace with whereever you installed Python and the script) This link can be used to launch the application without the console window and to drag&drop motortrace files into it or integrate it to the "Send To" menu.

For Help, see readme.txt and viewme.gif.

Changelog:
Version 2.1
Added request filter and -r REQUEST command line parameter.
Fixed: Problems with OXE R10 logs with bizarre message endings.

Version 2.0
Modified parsing engine:
Better support for SIP motortrace log files from OXE R10 (new date format)
Now possible to parse SIP log files from Omnitouch FAX server (FaxDriver.log)
Now possible to parse SIP log files from Genesys SIP server (ICE)
Known issues: Display issue with large files:
Only the last 3278 summary lines are displayed in the summary pane. Previous lines are left blank. This is probably a limitation of the GUI widget.

Hi LRU, seems like an interesting software... is there any download link outside that you could point me to... still moderated...
Now i've been using wireshark to test out the traces... just updated OXE to release 9.0 but got problem with SIP ... maybe this could help me find the problem ...

Hello,

I hust installed Python 2.6.2 from the link mentioned above.
If I try to start motview 1.6 I receive the following error message:
RuntimeError: Bad magic number in .pyc file

morview 1.3 works fine.

Thank your for your help

Hi,
you're right! This is because i compiled the Motorview v1.6 with Python 2.7.1.
Sorry for that, you need to install the latest Python 2.7 instead of 2.6.
I'll update the documentation accordingly.
